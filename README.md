# aspect-injection-pass-ont
Extension of the Standard-PASS-Ontology aiming to support aspect-oriented modeling with the Parallel Activity Specification Schema (PASS).

It specifies additional concepts needed for enriching standard PASS models with aspects - groups of advice process models whose behavior is later injected into core PASS process models according to pointcut definitions associated with the individual advice models.
